A literature review on blockchain technology and trust in the sahring economy

1 In this modern world, E-commerce is a widely used platform. Although Hong Kong used to be one of the main international finanical centres, there is some negative consequences in building up a critical business platform compared to other finanical centre. This paper has provide a new platform in a more easy way to achieve multi goals- multi layer cyber system enabled could platform with the CPeLS framework to give out a more effective way with high tech.

3 The main approach is to provide a new platform (CPeLS- Cyber Physical eCommerce Logistics System) with multi layers whcih includes the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platfrom as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). It aims to provide an upgrade and transformation of Hong Kong 's chain synchronisation decisions. This system includes distinct operation systems to run smoothly. They uses some novel ways different from a normal e-commerce platform whcih includes 6 layers in 3v levels of clud services that are interconnected.

4 The main positive consequences are they can use less space and less human resources which can reduce their operation cost. The scale of operation is much more smaller than the physical ones which is without the large scale of traditional channel of physical distribution process. By networking these systems and being able to draw on accurate digital data, business can connect with the outside world with increased confidence. This new system represents a new area of opportunities with supply chain efficiencies.

5 This channel offers a new area of opportunities. However, the warehouse is hard to manage various and large volume of spare space and each individual part is attached with handwritten code with no barcode coding system. There is no effective way to confirm the unique identification of goods and codes. This may cause more efforts on time and human resources to inout the data and management level cannot do informed decisions due to the lack of real time useful data which cannot solved timely. The mutual conflict is inevitable.  

6 This platform is developed with the fund from the HKSAR Innovation sonf Technology Support Program. The supply chain of this system helps to move the goods along from the business to business and to the end to the consumer. The system helps to mange and co-ordinate this and bring the business close together. We can make the impossibles into possibles. People should think more effective ways to improve Hong Kong e-commerce logistics system.
